The app does absolutely nothing. It just displays the picture of a gemstone and can be used to prove to your friends how rich you are. Armin actually made a total of 7 sales before the app was hastily removed by Apple. Nonetheless, it inspired a bunch of copycats on the Android App Store, but if you search today, you’ll find all of these apps have disappeared as well. The high installation numbers are likely gamed by making the app was available for free at some point to get reviews and appear more legitimate.\n",
